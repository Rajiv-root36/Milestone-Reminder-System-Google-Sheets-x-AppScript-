## 🔧 Modifying Timelines

All milestone timing is defined in the `TASKS_FT` and `TASKS_C` arrays at the top of `Code.gs`.

To change a timing, update the `offsetDays` value:
- Negative = before start date
- Positive = after start date
- 0 = on start date

After changing, run **Refresh all projects** if you have existing rows in the sheet.
